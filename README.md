# Predicting-Nifty-trend-for-next-day-with-Decision-Tree-and-Random-Forest

In financial markets there are a lot of hidden patterns which can be converted in profitable trading ideas .but we don't know them.  And they are hard to find as there millions of permutation and combination of the hypothesis that can be tested to find whether they work or not. And coming up with this hypothesis is a time-consuming task. but what if we could let the machine learning model do that job of finding patterns. we help the model by giving features and the model can try to find patterns in. But there is no limited to the extent of what features can be created and that is what I am trying to do. So one can create any features that they think might help model in giving better predictions. And if the model is able to find some patterns we can use those patterns to form a profitable trading strategy.that is what this project is about.
